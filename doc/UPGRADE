                    == Instructions for Upgrading Netdot ==


NOTE: Starting with Netdot 1.0.1, the upgrade script is able to perform several
version upgrades at once.

1. You may need to update the database schema in addition to the application.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING

After making a backup copy of your database, please execute the following command:

    # make upgrade

This will call a script that updates your current database to the schema required 
by the version you are upgrading to. 

Any errors found while applying these schema changes will be written to a file
called "error.log". You will need to inspect this file and make sure to correct
any problems before continuing. You may have to restore your database from backup,
fix any issues and start over.

2. Check for new required dependencies:

    # make testdeps

3. At this point you can do a 

    # make install [PARAMETERS]

4. Restart Apache
