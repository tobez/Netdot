=head1 NAME

Apache2::SiteControl::SectionAccessRule

=cut

=head2 DESCRIPTION

    This rule is going to be used in a system that automatically grants
    permission for everything (via the GrantAllRule). So this rule will
    only worry about what to deny, and the grants method can return whatever.

=cut

my $logger = Netdot->log->get_logger("Netdot::UI");
